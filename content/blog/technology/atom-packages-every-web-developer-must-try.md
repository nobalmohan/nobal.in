[Atom](https://atom.io) is my favourite text editor for development. Simple, clean and with over 6K+ packages built by the open source community.

Atom got everything you ask for. But, we are gonna cherry pick packages based on popularity and more useful for web developers in particular.

### [Emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)

Emmet is a toolkit for HTML/CSS. You type abbreviation syntax and emmet will parse them to produce expanded DOM elements.

### [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)

Basic linter for your code. You have to install language specific linter for better linting.

### [Atom Beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

### [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)

### [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)

Package to display colors directly in your editor. Support CSS, LESS, SCSS and Stylus file extension out of the box.

### [File Icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)

A vast collection of file icons in Atom for improved visual grepping. This package is in need of constant updates :)
